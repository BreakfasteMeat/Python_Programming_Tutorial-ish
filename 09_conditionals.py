# !! MUST UNDERSTAND BOOLEANS AND EVALUATING BOOLEAN ARITHMETIC BEFORE CONTINUING !!

# If statements can be used to run sections of code when a statment is true

x = 10
y = 5

# Code blocks are 
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")

# Statement/s in the if statement will run if the statement is true
# If the first statment is false, it will evaluate the next elif statement
# if none of the if and elif statments is true, it will then run the else statement
