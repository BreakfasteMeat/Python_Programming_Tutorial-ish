# The + Operator works differently when used between numeric data types and strings
# For numeric, it adds both the values, as if it is doing normal addition (more in 06_operators)
# For strings, it 'merges' both strings. This process is called String Concatenation

# - CASTING -
# This allows the conversion of one data type to another
