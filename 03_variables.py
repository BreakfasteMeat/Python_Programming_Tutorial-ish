# This is a variable. It is a container for storing data values
x = 10

# When declaring a variable, you can include letters, digits, and underscores
# BUT it must start with a letter or underscore

# VALID
data_32 = 123
_data = 456

# INVALID
#2cool = 99

# Variables are also CASE_SENSITIVE
age = 18
Age = 18
# In the example above, the two variables are considered to be DIFFERENT from each other


# There are many types of variables, most common of which are the following:

# NUMERIC
# int
int_example = 21

# float
float_example = 3.14

# BOOLEAN
# bool
bool_example_1 = True
bool_example_2 = False

# TEXT
# str
str_example_1 = "Hello World"
str_example_2 = 'Goodbye World'

# ----- EXPLANATION FOR THE STR DATATYPE (YOU CAN SKIP THIS PART) -----
# Strings are represented differently compared to the other datatypes
# It does not have a single "value", it is instead stored internally
# as a series of Unicode Characters.
# The strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters.
# In other programming languages (C, C++, Java, etc.) there is a
# data type not present in Python called a Char (Short for Character)
# It would represent a single Unicode character.
#
# Strings are much harder to handle in lower-level languages because
# of manual memory handling and such (I'm looking at you C).
