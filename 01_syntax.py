# This is a comment, think of it as a note written in code
# The '#' is what determines whether a line in the code is a comment or not
# I will be using comments to explain code snippets



# This is a print statement, this is used to display output to the console
print("Hello World!")

# Notice how in the above line, there is no '#'
# Python will interpret that line to be part of your program's code
# Executing this or copy-pasting it to an online compiler and then executing it would
# result to 'Hello World!' appearing in the console

# I will be using comments to explain in the following, series? I am not sure what to call this lmao
