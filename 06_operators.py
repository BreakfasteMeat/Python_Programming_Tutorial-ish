# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values (duh)


# ------ BASIC MATH OPERATIONS -----
print(10 + 5)
print(10 - 5)
print(10 * 5)
print(10 / 5) # Returns 2.0 (a float), even though the result is a whole number

# ----- ADVANCED OPERATIONS -----
# Normal division for control
print(7 / 2)

# Modulus Operator
# The result will be the REMAINDER of a division operator
print(7 % 2)
# Since 7 / 2 would be 3 remainder 1, the statement will output 1

# Exponentiation Operator
print(7 ** 2)
# For any operation x ** y, the result will be equal to x to the power of y

# Floor Division
print(7 // 2)
# This gives the largest possible INTEGER that is less than or equal to the result of the division
# E.G. 7 / 2 = 3.5, closest integer would be 3
