# In this script, there are three print statements one after the other
# The order they would appear in the console would start from the top till the very bottom

print("Hello World!")

print("Hello World 2!")

#print("Hello World 3!")

print("Goodbye World")

# It shows that code is run sequentially from TOP to BOTTOM (most of the time)
# Notice how it also skips printing "Hello World 3!" as it is considered as a comment

# A useful thing of note is that developers often "comment out" lines to temporarily disable them without deleting the code
# Try uncommenting the aforementioned "Hello World 3!" by removing the pound (#) symbol

# There are also special characters that you can type

# "/n" - New line
# This makes the characters after it be printed in the next line, like pressing the enter button in a document
print("1st Line\n2nd Line")

# "/t" - New Tab
# This creates a tab, equivalent to adding 4 spaces
print("\t this is a tab")
