# In this script, There are three print statements one after the other
# The order they would appear in the console would start from the top till the very bottom

print("Hello World!")

print("Hello World 2!")

# print("Hello World 3!")

print("Goodbye World")

# It shows that code is run sequentially from TOP to BOTTOM (most of the time)
# Notice how it also skips printing "Hello World 3!" as it is considered as a comment
