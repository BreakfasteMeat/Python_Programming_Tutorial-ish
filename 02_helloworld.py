# In this script, there are three print statements one after the other
# The order they would appear in the console would start from the top till the very bottom

print("Hello World!")

print("Hello World 2!")

#print("Hello World 3!")

print("Goodbye World")

# It shows that code is run sequentially from TOP to BOTTOM (most of the time)
# Notice how it also skips printing "Hello World 3!" as it is considered as a comment

# A useful thing of note is that developers often "comment out" lines to temporarily disable them without deleting the code
# Try uncommenting the aforementioned "Hello World 3!" by removing the pound (#) symbol

## ---------- CHALLENGES ----------
# 1. (EASY)
# Create a program that prints your full name, age, and grade-level. You can design it as you prefer!
